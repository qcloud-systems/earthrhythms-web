# Earthrhythms

Earthrhythms explores the cycles that shape our world — tides, seasons, lunar phases, and the subtle gravitational dances between Earth, Moon, and Sun. These rhythms influence oceans, weather, biology, and the quiet pulse of the planet itself.

This project blends science, sound, and observation to reveal the patterns that connect us to the natural world.
