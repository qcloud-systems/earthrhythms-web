# Celestial Cycles

Earth’s rhythms are shaped by cycles far beyond our atmosphere.

## Lunar Cycles
- **Synodic month (29.5 days):** new moon to new moon  
- **Sidereal month (27.3 days):** Moon’s orbit relative to the stars  
- **Nodal cycle (18.6 years):** tilt of the Moon’s orbit shifts over time  

## Solar Cycles
- **Seasons:** caused by Earth’s axial tilt  
- **Solar cycle (11 years):** sunspot activity rises and falls  

## Planetary Cycles
Planets move in repeating patterns that create conjunctions, oppositions, and resonances.

These cycles influence tides, climate, and biological rhythms.
