# Tides & Waves

Tides are the Earth's most visible rhythmic motion. They rise and fall in response to the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, creating patterns that repeat with remarkable precision.

## Lunar Influence
The Moon’s gravity pulls ocean water toward it, creating a bulge — a high tide. As the Earth rotates, coastlines move through these bulges, producing two high tides and two low tides each day.

## Spring & Neap Tides
- **Spring tides** occur during new and full moons, when Earth, Moon, and Sun align.
- **Neap tides** occur during quarter moons, when gravitational forces partially cancel.

## Long-Period Waves
Earth’s oceans also resonate with long-period waves, shaped by basin geometry and planetary rotation.

Tides are the heartbeat of the ocean.
